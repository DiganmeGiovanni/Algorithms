Sorting algorithms
==================

## Selection sorting
The selection algorithms substracts the lowest element
(or greater for `DESC` sorting) of an array and push it
into an array of sorted elements. After that iterates the
remaning elements and repeat the process until all elements
are sorted.

1. Subtracts the lowest element of array
2. Push substracted element into array of sorted elements
3. Remove subtracted element from original array
4. Repeat from begining until all elements are sorted
